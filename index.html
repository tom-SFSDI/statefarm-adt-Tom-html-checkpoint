            Texas has been around for a long time. We were even our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Texas">own country</a> at one point. We fought a long hard battle for independence from Mexico. Back in 1836, a Mexican general doubted
            the resolve of Texans. After a battle at San Jacinto we sent him packing back to Mexico City and established ourselves as an Independent nation. After a few years the United States begged us to join them. After a few years of persistence on
            the part of the US, we begrudingly joined them on December 29, 1845, becoming the 28th US State.

            California is well known for the gold rush as well as Hollywood. Hollywood is pretty cool and has a lot of movie stars living there. But other than Hollywood California is also known for high taxes, homelessness, and earthquakes. So that is definitely
            something to take into consideration.

            South Carolina people constantly fly their flag around all over the place. The crescent moon and palmetto tree are cool I guess. They do have legit BBQ. But you know what it isn't? A lone star on red white and blue. So, it just isnt the same. I give them
            respect, but I'm not packing my bags or anything.

            Florida is definitely a top state. They have low taxes. No income tax actually. The weather is great. They also get a ton of tourists who basically fund the state, which is what allows them to keep their taxes low. If you want to entertain yourself, Florida
            has a lot of top attractions like Disney and Universal as well as Sea World. But, alligators and hurricanes. Yes, TX has those too, but FL has more.
